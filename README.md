## Navbar Component

The `Navbar` component represents the website's navigation bar. It allows users to easily access different sections of the website through a menu. The component includes the following features:

- A logo displaying the initials "YA."
- A horizontal menu (visible on medium to large screens) with links to the "Home," "About," "Skills," and "Works" sections using the `react-scroll` library.
- A hamburger icon (visible on small screens) that opens a mobile menu when clicked.
- The mobile menu contains the same links as the horizontal menu, allowing users to navigate the website on small screens conveniently.
- Social icons for LinkedIn, GitHub, Email, and Resume, which are styled as buttons with hover effects.

The background color is set to royal blue, maintaining a consistent visual theme.
